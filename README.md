[![CI](https://github.com/abu-lib/types/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/abu-lib/types/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is part of the [Abu](http://github.com/abu-lib/abu) meta-project.

This is mostly a pile of utilities to supplement the standard library's type building blocks:
`std::tuple<>`, `std::optional`, `std::variant<>`, etc...

# abu::tuple

It's the same thing as `std::tuple`, but it can be used as a structural type.
